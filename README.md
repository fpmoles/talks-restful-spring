## Project Background ##
This project concept was dual serving. First I needed a real life project to use for demos for the presentation. I am a firm believer in demo software being conceptually real.
This software is also inline with my Master's Project for the University of Kansas MSIT program, where I am working on a system to help protect enterprise collection, storage,
and distribution of customer Personal Identifiable Information (PII) data.

This system will provide data access services of PII data stored in an NoSQL data store. This project for this presentation does not perform the full design of the ultimate
project for the MSIT program, as it is only being designed to provide the service framework. The data access is provided to replicate a real system for conceptual vision only.
